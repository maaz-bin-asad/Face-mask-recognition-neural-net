# Face-mask-recognition-neural-net
Built on google cloud and by applying transfer learning (VGG16 pre trained neural net)

<h2>About the model</h2>
 I used transfer learning to create the model, since I was having less dataset for it. The model is built on Google Colab.
 First task is to import pre process the data and then, build a classifier to classify mask and non mask images. 
Later,the face recognition system using Haar Cascade classifiers detect faces and classify whether that frame is containing mask or not
